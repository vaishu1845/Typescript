Q.Diff b/w typescript and javascript?

    typescript: datatype is fixed,detect the error immediately.code maintaince,easier to learn,static typing
    javascript: datatype is not fixed.it will run the code and later it detects the error,has dynamic typing.
 
Q.why ts?

 because it has types.js has no types.

    Datatypes--Every value or data has an associated type nothing but datatype.
               Determines how the value or data can be used in programm.

    a.String--Enclosed with ""  eg;"123"
    b.integer--Any number       eg;1,2,0,-1,-2
    c.Float--decimal number     eg:1.0, 20.3
    d.Boolean--True or False
    e.enums
    f.objects,
    g.void--use to represent non returning functions.
