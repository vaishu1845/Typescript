**Control statements: 

Changes the flow of execution of statements

1.conditional statements,
2.loops,
3.continue,break

1.conditional statements:-

In control statements we have lots of conditional statements like

a.if,else if, and----decision making 

  eg.,amazon, flipkart

  if(price=51,000 and color=blue and memory=128gb and deliveryin = 2 days)

  order from amazon

  else if (price=49,000 and color=blue and memory=128gb and deliveryin = 7 days)

  order from flipkart

  else

  order from chroma

b.switch cases---(this or that) 

  directly placing the order
  
  case 1: price=51,000 and color=blue and memory=128gb and deliveryin = 2 days

  order from amazon 

  case 2: price=49,000 and color=blue and memory=128gb and deliveryin = 7 days 

  order from flipkart 

  default: 
  
  order from chroma

2.Loops:-

 doing the same activity so many times 

  a.for loop

  b.while loop 

  c.do while

a.for loop:-

  eg.,Sum of n natural numbers using for loop 

   var sum = 0;
   const n = 100
   for(var i=1;i<=n;i++){
   sum = sum + i
   }
   console.log(sum); 

  ouput: 5050 
  
  for loop--

 for(initial value;termination_condition;steps/incrementals/step by which value should incrementation.

 while--

 initial condition-steps/incrementals/step by which value should incrementation.

 eg.,if(i<=100) then while is stoped.

 do while--
 first do{} then while(condition) is executed.

>Javascript and typescript programmes are executed in synchronous way.i.e.,step by step.
