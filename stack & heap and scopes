>> Stack and heap:--

  (a)Stack--

  1.It is a linear data structure.

  2.Memory is allocated in continuous block.

  3.The memory for a stack is allocated and deallocated automatically using the instructions of the compiler.

  4.It costs less to build and maintain a stack.

  5.It is easy to implement.

  6.It is fixed in size; hence it is not flexible.

  7.Its only disadvantage is the shortage of memory, since it is fixed in size.

  8.If all the blocks are not occupied, memory gets wasted too.

  9.It takes less time to access the elements of a stack.

  10.It has an excellent locality of reference. 

  (b)Heap-- 

  1.It is a hierarchical data structure.

  2.Memory is allocated in a random block.

  3.The memory is allocated and deallocated manually by the programmer.

  4.It is costly to build and maintain a heap.

  5.It is difficult to implement a heap structure.

  6.It takes more time to access elements of a heap.

  7.The disadvantage of heap is fragmentation of memory.

  8.Resizing is possible in heap.

  9.Hence, memory is not wasted.

  10.It has adequate locality of reference.

 >>Scopes:- 

Scopes define that we are able to access the variable or not.

 Global and local 

 a)Global:- 
   
   -Global variables are declared outside the programming constructs.
  
   -These variables can be accessed from any where within code.

   -These variables are also called fields.That are declared within class but outside the methods.

  b)Local:- 

   -These variables are accessible only within the construct where they are declared.

   -Declared within the block like methods,loops etc.,
