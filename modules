Modules:- 

It is a chunk of code, that will be used to maintain modularity of the component/class. 

Modules are implemented by:- 

Export and Import. 

a) Export:- Any declaration (such as a variable, function,class,interface etc) can be exported by adding the export keyword.

   Export statements are handy when exports need to be renamed for consumers.

  e.g.,Stringvalidator.ts--

  export interface StringValidator {
  isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;
  }

b) Import:-mporting is just about as easy as exporting from a module. Importing an exported declaration is done through using one of the import forms.

-> ./ - 1 file back 
-> ../ - 2 files back.
